<h6>Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects</h6> <br>
<h7>During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects <br> for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating <br> Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of <br> the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon <br> torpedoes.</h7>
